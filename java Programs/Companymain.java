/*Write a program that demonstrates handling of exceptions in inheritance tree. Assume a company having employees between
 18 to 60 years and company started in 2005. Create a base class called company and derived class called employee
 which extends the base class. In company class, implement a constructor which takes the year of joining of employee in 
 this company and throws the exception Not Possible( ) when the input year of joining <2005. In employee class, implement
  a constructor that  throws an exception if employeeâ€™s 18<age >60. */
